# Performance Comparison between Switch and If Statement
In my knowledge, switch statement is better than if statement when it comes to performance thanks for compiler's optimization.
However, one of my colleague said there is no different because switch statement is transformed into comparision assembly language like if statement.
I googled and found that switch statement could be better. There are several preconditions like number of cases and range of case.
So I conducted several test on my labtop to see the preconditions they said.
The reconditions they said are:
* Number of cases
* Range of cases
